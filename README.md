This repository is developed by Giobbe Forni and contains all the code used to study the molecular groundplan of a plant-ant interaction.

Most of the code was generated for RNA-seq of the ant Crematogaster scutellaris and the plant Vicia faba.

Additionaly, metagenomics of leaf lamina and and proteomics of extra-floral nectar have been performed.

In here Vicia faba will be reverenced as "vicia" and "Crematogaster scutellaris as "crema"".

Experiment reads have been deposited under the BioProject PRJNA758979.
