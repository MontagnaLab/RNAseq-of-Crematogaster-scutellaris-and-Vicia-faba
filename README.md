This repo was developed from [this one](https://github.com/for-giobbe/PAINT/tree/main) and contains all  code used to study the groundplan of a plant-ant interaction.

Most of the code was generated for RNA-seq of the ant Crematogaster scutellaris and the plant Vicia faba.

In here Vicia faba will be reverenced as "vicia" and "Crematogaster scutellaris as "crema"".

Experiment reads have been deposited under the BioProject PRJNA758979.

Here are the descriptions of the major analytical steps:

- part 0 - markdowns/part_0.txt - requirements and dataset explanation
- part 1 - markdowns/part_1.txt - reads qc & pre-processing
- part 2 - markdowns/part_2.txt - trascriptomes assembly, annotation and filtering
- part 3 - markdowns/part_3.txt - expression analyses in vicia
- part 4 - markdowns/part_4.txt - expression analyses in crema
